# CyberSecGame
A tower defence game teaching players about cyber security 

# #AboutTheProject
This an ongoing solo project, which was a part of Internship Project at Tallinn University's Schoold Of Digital Technology Department.


The project's primary focus is to create a tower defence game teaching players about cybersecurity.

# #Intro

This project was co-created with Peadar Callaghan from Tallinn University's School of Digital Technologies. 
The game's enemies will be represented as cyberthreats. The turrets will be depicted as tools for detection and mitigation. 
Future objectives include continuing to enhance the game and doing player research to identify the game's potential benefits in terms of raising cybersecurity threat awareness.

//README will be updated later when the game closes the pre-alpha release.
